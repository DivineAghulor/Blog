Blog Project

This is a simple blog site I created using ejs templates and express.
It's a project to practice my EJS skills, so it's not connected to an external database

I mainly used bootstrap for the styling

Extra styling  can be added in the style.css file.
The help will be appreciated ;-)

To run this app you need Node.js
